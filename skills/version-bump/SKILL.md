# Version Bump Skill

Manage semantic versioning across any project with consistent updates to all version-tracked files.

## Quick Reference

**Common files requiring updates:**
1. `package.json` (line 3) - Node.js projects
2. `pyproject.toml` - Python projects
3. Additional project-specific version files

**Semantic versioning:**
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Bugfixes only
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New features, backward compatible
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes

## Quick Decision Guide

**What changed?**
- "Fixed a bug" → PATCH (5.3.0 → 5.3.1)
- "Added new feature" → MINOR (5.3.0 → 5.4.0)
- "Breaking change" → MAJOR (5.3.0 → 6.0.0)

**If unclear, ASK THE USER explicitly.**

## Standard Workflow

See [operations/workflow.md](operations/workflow.md) for detailed step-by-step process.

**Quick version:**
1. Determine version type (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR)
2. Calculate new version from current
3. Preview changes to user
4. Update ALL THREE files
5. Verify consistency
6. Build and test
7. Commit and create git tag
8. Push and create GitHub release
9. Generate CHANGELOG.md from releases and commit
10. Post Discord notification

## Common Scenarios

See [operations/scenarios.md](operations/scenarios.md) for examples:
- Bug fix releases
- New feature releases
- Breaking change releases

## Critical Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Update ALL files with matching version numbers
- Create git tag with format `vX.Y.Z`
- Create GitHub release from the tag
- Generate CHANGELOG.md from releases after creating release
- Post Discord notification after release
- Ask user if version type is unclear

**NEVER:**
- Update only one files
- Skip the verification step
- Forget to create git tag or GitHub release

## Verification Checklist

Before considering the task complete:
- [ ] All files have matching version numbers
- [ ] `bun run build` succeeds
- [ ] Git commit created with all version files
- [ ] Git tag created (format: vX.Y.Z)
- [ ] Commit and tags pushed to remote
- [ ] GitHub release created from the tag
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md generated and committed
- [ ] Discord notification sent

## Reference Commands

```bash
# View current version (Node.js)
grep '"version"' package.json

# View current version (Python)
grep '^version' pyproject.toml

# Verify consistency across all version files (adjust paths as needed)
grep '"version"' package.json pyproject.toml

# View git tags
git tag -l -n1

# Check what will be committed
git status
git diff package.json pyproject.toml
```
