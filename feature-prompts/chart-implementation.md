### Custom Annotations
- Selectively displays annotations for important years only
- Uses custom positioning logic for each annotation with mathematical calculations
- Includes custom styling for annotations (arrows, borders, colors)

### Advanced Hover Information
- Rich hover templates with formatted values and multiple data fields
- Custom styling for hover labels

### Professional Styling
- Custom title and axis formatting
