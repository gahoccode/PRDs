# PRDs - Portfolio Risk and Diversification Strategies

This repository contains work-in-progress Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for portfolio optimization and risk management strategies. These PRDs have been carefully planned before implementation to ensure high-quality, well-structured code.

## Purpose

The documents in this repository serve as detailed specifications for implementing various portfolio optimization techniques, including:

- Black-Litterman model implementations
- Modern Portfolio Theory applications
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Diversification strategies

## Status

These are living documents that evolve as implementation progresses. Each PRD outlines the technical requirements, implementation steps, and quality standards for the corresponding portfolio strategy.

## Development Approach

Our development approach follows these principles:
1. Careful planning and specification before coding
2. Modular design with clear separation of concerns
3. Comprehensive testing of financial algorithms
4. Documentation of financial interpretation and implementation details

Feel free to explore the PRDs to understand the design decisions behind our portfolio optimization implementations.
