📄 Frontend PRD / Spec (Python-based Web Apps)

1. Overview

The frontend will be a responsive web interface built with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.
It will serve as the presentation layer for a Python-based backend (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.).
The frontend should focus on:
	•	Simplicity → easy to adapt to different data models.
	•	Consistency → unified professional look and feel across dashboards, forms, and tables.

⸻

2. Goals
	•	Provide clean, professional UI suitable for finance, data-driven, or enterprise-grade applications.
	•	Support dynamic data rendering via REST API/JSON responses from the backend.
	•	Enable fast prototyping while remaining production-ready.
	•	Ensure responsive design (desktop-first, but adaptive for tablets and mobile).

⸻

3. Core Components (depends on project scope)

The frontend will include the following reusable UI building blocks:

3.1 Layout
	•	Navigation bar (header with branding + user profile dropdown).
	•	Sidebar (optional for dashboards, collapsible).
	•	Content area (main section for rendering API-driven data).

3.2 Forms
	•	Input fields (text, numbers, dates, dropdowns, toggles).
	•	Multi-step forms (wizard style, if needed).
	•	Validation states (error, success, disabled).
	•	Submit + reset buttons.

3.3 Data Presentation
	•	Tables
	•	Charts (specified by user request, plotly, recharts, etc...).
	•	Cards (summary stats, KPIs).

3.4 Feedback
	•	Loading spinners.
	•	Toast notifications (success, error, info).
	•	Modal dialogs (confirmations, details).

3.5 User Session Elements
	•	Login form / authentication placeholder.
	•	Profile dropdown.
	•	Session-aware navigation (show/hide menu items).

⸻

4. Integration with Backend
	•	API-driven rendering → All dynamic content (tables, charts, forms) fetch data from backend
	•	Session awareness → Use tokens/cookies as provided by backend (abstracted).

⸻

5. Styling & Theming
	•	Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
	•	Flowbite component library via CDN (for prebuilt UI widgets).
	•	Support for light/dark mode toggle.
	•	Theme customization via Tailwind config (optional).

⸻

6. Non-Goals
	•	No business logic handled in frontend (all logic in backend).

⸻

7. Success Criteria
	•	Frontend can be connected to any Python backend with minimal changes.
	•	UI components are reusable across finance dashboards, portfolio analysis tools, or internal enterprise apps.
	•	Developers can prototype new pages quickly using Flowbite + Tailwind utilities.
