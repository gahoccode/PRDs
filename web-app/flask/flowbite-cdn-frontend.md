ðŸ“„ Frontend PRD / Spec (Python-based Web Apps)

1. Overview

The frontend will be a responsive web interface built with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.
It will serve as the presentation layer for a Python-based backend (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.).
The frontend should focus on:
	â€¢	Simplicity â†’ easy to adapt to different data models.
	â€¢	Consistency â†’ unified professional look and feel across dashboards, forms, and tables.

â¸»

2. Goals
	â€¢	Provide clean, professional UI suitable for finance, data-driven, or enterprise-grade applications.
	â€¢	Support dynamic data rendering via REST API/JSON responses from the backend.
	â€¢	Enable fast prototyping while remaining production-ready.
	â€¢	Ensure responsive design (desktop-first, but adaptive for tablets and mobile).

3. Core Components (depends on project scope)

The frontend will include the following reusable UI building blocks:

3.1 Layout
	â€¢	Navigation bar (header with branding + user profile dropdown).
	â€¢	Sidebar (optional for dashboards, collapsible).
	â€¢	Content area (main section for rendering API-driven data).

3.2 Forms
	â€¢	Input fields (text, numbers, dates, dropdowns, toggles).
	â€¢	Multi-step forms (wizard style, if needed).
	â€¢	Validation states (error, success, disabled).
	â€¢	Submit + reset buttons.

3.3 Data Presentation
	â€¢	Tables
	â€¢	Charts (specified by user request, plotly, recharts, etc...).
	â€¢	Cards (summary stats, KPIs).

3.4 Feedback
	â€¢	Loading spinners.
	â€¢	Toast notifications (success, error, info).
	â€¢	Modal dialogs (confirmations, details).

3.5 User Session Elements
	â€¢	Login form / authentication placeholder.
	â€¢	Profile dropdown.
	â€¢	Session-aware navigation (show/hide menu items).

4. Integration with Backend
	â€¢	API-driven rendering â†’ All dynamic content (tables, charts, forms) fetch data from backend
	â€¢	Session awareness â†’ Use tokens/cookies as provided by backend (abstracted).

5. Styling & Theming
	â€¢	Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
	â€¢	Flowbite component library via CDN (for prebuilt UI widgets).
	â€¢	Support for light/dark mode toggle.
	â€¢	Theme customization via Tailwind config (optional).

â¸»

6. Non-Goals
	â€¢	No business logic handled in frontend (all logic in backend).

â¸»

7. Success Criteria
	â€¢	Frontend can be connected to any Python backend with minimal changes.
	â€¢	UI components are reusable across finance dashboards, portfolio analysis tools, or internal enterprise apps.
	â€¢	Developers can prototype new pages quickly using Flowbite + Tailwind utilities.
