# üìÑ General PRD: Streamlit Web App with Reusable Backend

---

## 1. Overview

Got it üëç ‚Äî you want a general, reusable PRD for building a Streamlit web app, but with the important constraint that the backend logic should be reusable across other frontend stacks (e.g., Flask+Tailwind, React, Next.js, etc.).

The project will deliver a Streamlit web app for rapid prototyping and internal usage.
The backend (business logic, data processing, financial models, API endpoints) will be decoupled from Streamlit, enabling reuse across other frontend stacks (Flask, React, Next.js, etc.).

The focus is to ensure that Streamlit serves as a thin UI layer, while the backend remains modular and framework-agnostic.

---

## 2. Goals

- Provide a functional prototype with Streamlit for quick iteration and feedback.
- Ensure backend logic is implemented in a separate, reusable Python package or module.
- Allow easy migration to alternative frontends without rewriting business logic.
- Support data input/output via APIs or modular function calls.

---

## 3. Architecture

### Frontend (Streamlit)
- Handles UI (forms, charts, tables, file uploads).
- Calls backend functions (via Python imports or REST API).
- Displays backend results interactively.

### Backend (Reusable Layer)
- Encapsulated as standalone Python modules/packages.
- Provides functions for:
  - Data ingestion & validation
  - Portfolio & asset analysis
  - Optimization algorithms
  - Risk metrics & analytics
- Optionally exposed as REST API (Flask/FastAPI) for decoupled frontend consumption.

---

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Backend Layer
- Reusable Python package (/backend folder or separate repo).
- Functions are pure Python: take inputs (dict, pandas DataFrame, JSON) ‚Üí return outputs (dict, DataFrame, JSON).
- Optional REST API wrappers (/api folder with Flask/FastAPI).

### 4.2 Streamlit UI Layer
- Form inputs for user parameters (portfolio allocations, constraints, assumptions).
- Display components:
  - Tables (portfolio composition, transactions).
  - Charts (performance over time, risk-return, allocation pie charts).
  - KPIs (summary metrics).
- File upload/download support (CSV, Excel).
- Session state management for user input persistence.

---

## 5. Integration

### Direct import method:
- Streamlit imports backend Python modules directly.
- Best for prototypes and internal testing.

### API method (optional):
- Backend also exposes REST API endpoints.
- Streamlit fetches results via requests ‚Üí simulates how React/Next.js frontend would consume it.

---

## 6. Non-Goals

- Streamlit app will not contain core business logic.
- No dependency on Streamlit-specific session state in backend.
- No assumption of one specific frontend stack (backend must remain frontend-agnostic).

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Streamlit app works as a functional prototype for finance workflows.
- Backend package is reusable across:
  - Streamlit
  - Flask + Tailwind/Flowbite
  - React/Next.js
- Minimal rework required to migrate from Streamlit to a production-grade frontend.
- Backend can be containerized and deployed independently (e.g., on Render, AWS Lambda).

---

## ‚ö° TL;DR:

- **Streamlit** = UI sandbox (fast prototyping).
- **Backend** = reusable Python module/API (production-ready).
- This separation ensures a smooth upgrade path to enterprise-grade frontends later.
